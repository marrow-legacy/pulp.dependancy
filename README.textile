h1. Middleware Dependancy Graphing

Often there is a need for the ability to define that one layer of middleware consumes the resources offered by another.  For example, authentication mechanisms may require access to a global session system, transactional database layer, or both.  Other middleware may require being placed at the beginning or end of the stack, e.g. GZip compression or profiling.

Currently there is no way for middleware developers to declare these dependancies anywhere but their documentation, which can lead to developer frustration as they work out the kinks in a middleware stack.

@Pulp-Dependancy@ is a module which provides a global registry for both entry-point and manually attached middleware objects.  Additionally, @Pulp-Dependancy@ monitors for new and updated entry-point middleware and can automatically reload individual middleware when changes are detected.
